                    <p><b>Who Are We? </b>
                    The girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, gEECS for short, was founded in 2002.
                    We are a student-run organization at the University of Michigan dedicated to encouraging the professional,
                    academic, and social development of women in technology-related fields of study.Through a variety of social 
                    and professional events, we hope to contribute to an increase of women in EECS.
                    <br /><br />
                    Let us know if you want to be added to the mailing list.  
                    A huge thanks to our faculty advisors Dr. Emily Provost and Dr. Valeria Bertacco!! :) <br/><br />

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>gEECS was founded for the purpose of bringing women in electrical engineering, computer engineering, 
                and computer science together to provide a professional, social, and academic support network.
                In an effort to promote the education and success of technologically inclined women, gEECS reaches out
                to women ranging from middle school girls to graduate students. Currently the number of women in EECS is
                steadily decreasing and we hope to help change that.</p>
                <h3>Join</h3>
                <p>In order to make gEECS as accessible as possible for everyone, there are no dues or service hour 
                requirements. To join, simply email the officers at geecs.officers@umich.edu with your name, uniqname
                name, major, and estimated graduation date and then just start coming to functions! If you have any
                questions feel free to email us.</p>

              <h2>External gEECS Sponsorship</h2>
              <div class="full_size main_content">
                gEECS would love to have you added as a sponsor! There are many ways to
                be a sponsor in many ways to get involved! As female students in EECS, our
                members face challenging situations every day! This organization is dedicated to
                supporting these students, but we could not do it without external support! If you
                would like to help gEECS and our mission, hopefully this page will help you find the
                perfect ways to be involved! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the
                gEECS officers at <a href="mailto:geecs.officers@umich.edu?Subject=sponsorship">geecs.officers@umich.edu!</a> <br /><br />

                gEECS Mentor / Mentee Program:<br />  
                In the Winter 2013 term, gEECS will be launching their first mentor/mentee
                program. This program is intended to support female EECS students at different
                positions in life with a mentor or mentee to assist in their current and present
                academic, social, and career decisions. We support first-year, undeclared students
                who are interested in gEECS, declared undergraduate students, and a wide-range of
                graduate students. Presently, gEECS has recruited some alum and current faculty to
                assist in this program, but we will need a lot more support if we intend to keep
                growing this program!
                If you are interested in being a mentor or helping with this program, please
                contact the gEECS officers at geecs.officers@umich.edu or the gEECS faculty
                advisors!<br /><br />

                *Please note, that for the safety of our members, the UM College of Engineering may do a background
                check or take other precautions before we implement a relationship with you.<br /><br />

                gEECS Event Support:<br />
                gEECS tries to implement about one event a month. Our events vary from
                social, to academic, to professional. If you (or your organization) would like to
                sponsor and/or participate in an event with us, please email the officers at
                geecs.officers@umich.edu with a range of dates you are available and ideas you
                would like to participate in. Please contact us at least a few months prior, giving us
                enough time to coordinate and work together. We cannot guarantee that we can
                schedule every event, but we do try to implement as much as possible!
                Moreover, if you would like to financially support our organization, please
                read the next section!<br /><br />

                gEECS Financial Support:<br />
                Our members have had incredible opportunities through our sponsors. For
                example, in March 2011, gEECS went to on a trip to the Chicago Museum of Science
                and Industry free of all transportation, entrance, and hotels costs. Furthermore, in
                fall 2012, many gEECS members went to the Grace Hopper Conference with little to
                no cost to them.<br />
                gEECS tries our very best to provide everything free of cost to our members.
                Obviously this can become costly. In order to keep offering great resources and
                opportunities, we rely on external financial support. If you would like to give a gift
                to gEECS (or sponsor an event), we would be forever grateful!<br /><br />

                The University of Michigan has specific procedures to donations. Please read
                the following and try to find which best describes your donation. J and thank-you!<br /><br />

                1) If you are working with gEECS for an event and are sending in funds to pay
                for supplies or respources for the event, please send your payment directly

                the gEECS officers (at geecs.officers@umich.edu) and Ms. Jennifer Wegner
                (jwegner@umich.edu) to arrange for the donation. We will be able to
                provide a tax ID code for you, once the University procedures have been
                implemented.
                Through Ms. Wegner, we will be able to make sure that the funds both reach
                gEECS and are used for their intended purposes.<br />

                For other donations and sponsorships, all donations will have to go through
                Ms. Wegner, from the College of Engineering. She will notify both the officers and
                yourself with the proper procedures. For more information, please see:<br />

                Please note that gEECS and the University of Michigan encourages both
                parties to keep all records of payments for seven years for tax purposes.<br /><br />

                <div class="full_size main_content">
                  Vision: The mentoring program is to support women in EECS by giving our members an avenue to meet new people,
                  get to know others in gEECs, share ideas and experiences, and make new friends! :D
                  <br /><br />
                  Mentors and mentees are paired up at the beginning of each semester based on similar interests. 
                  Pairings are changed every semester but we encourage keeping in contact and meeting up with your previous buddies!
